A Webpack 5 boilerplate with React and TypeScript. Babel 7 compiles the TypeScript files to ES5. The Webpack module "fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin" handles the type checking. The demo App serve React routing, a Webpack logo, my photo with some info and compiled PostCSS. Bootstrap CSS was used to make the demo mobile friendly.
