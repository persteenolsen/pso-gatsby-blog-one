Django is using the architectural pattern Model-View-Template (MVT) which is a derivation of the pattern Model View Control (MVC) 

This Django Website is serving static content - secured by HTTPS

A simple Blog, a list of Employees and Todos demonstrates how to use Models (CRUD) by the Django Admin and display the Posts, Employees and Todos by the Frontend

The Employees and Todos are also administrated by the Frontend with CRUD functionality

The files models.py and views.py are splitted up for showing how to scale the folder structure if the Django Website should grow with a lot of views and models

CI / CD by VS Code + GitHub + Vercel Cloud
